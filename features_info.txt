GPT summary of features : 

✅ 1. Chroma Features (chroma_stft, chroma_cqt, chroma_cens)

Chroma features describe the intensity of the 12 pitch classes (C, C#, D, …, B) regardless of octave. They are widely used in music analysis, genre classification, chord recognition, and tonal similarity.

✔️ chroma_stft

Computed using the short-time Fourier transform.
Represents how much energy each pitch class has in each short time window.

✔️ chroma_cqt

Computed using the constant-Q transform, which has a logarithmic frequency scale aligned with music notes.
More musically natural and stable for harmonic content.

✔️ chroma_cens

“Chroma Energy Normalized Statistics.”
A smoothed, more robust version of chroma designed to be invariant to dynamics, emphasizing harmonic patterns rather than exact amplitudes.
Useful for similarity, cover-song detection, and noisy conditions.

✔️ Why 12 values for each statistic?

Because each chroma vector has 12 bins (one per pitch class).
You then compute summary statistics:

max: peak energy of each pitch class

mean: overall average pitch-class energy

median: typical central value

min: lowest energy

std: variability

skew: asymmetry in distribution

kurtosis: how “peaked” or “heavy-tailed” the distribution is

✅ 2. MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)

MFCCs summarize the spectral envelope—a compact representation of timbre.
librosa typically produces 20 MFCC coefficients, each capturing a different aspect of the sound’s spectral shape.

You computed for each of the 20 coefficients:

kurtosis

max

mean

median

min

skew

std

✔️ What MFCCs represent:

Lower MFCCs → overall spectral slope (brightness/darkness)

Higher MFCCs → fine-grained spectral details (timbre texture)

Widely used in speech recognition, emotion detection, speaker identification, and music genre classification.

✅ 3. RMSE (Root Mean Square Energy)

Measures signal energy over time.

Summary statistics represent:

highest energy (max)

average loudness (mean)

typical loudness (median)

dynamic range (min, std)

shape of the energy distribution (skew, kurtosis)

Essential for tasks involving onset detection, loudness, and dynamics.

✅ 4. Spectral Features

These describe the frequency content of the audio:

✔️ spectral_centroid

“Center of mass” of the spectrum → brightness of the sound.

✔️ spectral_bandwidth

Spread of the spectrum around the centroid → spectral width.

✔️ spectral_rolloff

Frequency below which a percentage (usually 85%) of spectral energy lies → relates to high-frequency content.

Each has stats: max, mean, median, min, skew, kurtosis, std.

✅ 5. Spectral Contrast

Spectral contrast measures the difference between peaks and valleys in the spectrum across 7 frequency bands.

Interpretation:

High contrast → strong harmonics or clear musical notes

Low contrast → noisy, broadband signals

You computed 7-band statistics for each of:

kurtosis

max

mean

median

min

skew

std

This yields many columns because spectral contrast produces 7 numbers per frame.

✅ 6. Tonnetz (Tonal Centroid Features)

Derived from harmonic analysis; describes relationships among pitch classes based on music theory (circle of fifths, major/minor modes).

Tonnetz gives 6 dimensions, which relate to:

consonance/dissonance

harmonic progression

tonal stability

You computed:

kurtosis, max, mean, median, min, skew, std for each of the 6 tonnetz dimensions.

Used in genre classification, chord recognition, mood/emotion prediction.

✅ 7. ZCR (Zero Crossing Rate)

Counts how often the signal crosses zero → relates to noisiness or high-frequency content.

High ZCR → fricatives in speech, noisy instruments

Low ZCR → voiced speech, smoother tones

You extracted summary stats: max, mean, median, min, skew, kurtosis, std.

🎯 In summary

These features capture nearly every dimension of the audio signal:

Category	What it describes
Chroma family	Harmonic & pitch-class energy
MFCCs	Timbre (spectral envelope)
RMSE	Loudness & dynamics
Spectral centroid/bandwidth/rolloff	Frequency distribution & brightness
Spectral contrast	Harmonic peaks vs valleys
Tonnetz	Tonal relationships (music theory)
ZCR	Noisiness & high-frequency activity
